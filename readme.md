#JQuery and Ajax - Deaf Grandma Tutorial
####Phase 3 Research
Team: Jimmy, Dan, Luisa, Chae

##Out of the Box
When creating a `rails new` application:
-  `jquery-rails` gem will automatically be provided in the gemfile.
-  `app_root/app/assets/javascripts/application.js` will automatically require jquery and jquery-ujs (unobtrusive javascript) functionality.

##Getting Started
-  Building from Rails-The-Sinatra-Way by Keith Tom, we are going to start from a Deaf Grandma application that has been formatted to use partials and a page resource.

##Terminology

-Unobstrusive JS: Instead of writing inline JS, the Rails convention is to separate concerns and separate JS out from HTML. 

##Links
-  On the Index view, added remote to link
-  Created new.js.erb with javascript functions

##Forms
